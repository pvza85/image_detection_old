# Mobile Image Detection using features extracted by Deep Learning
I am trying to detect one-shot images using featuers extracted from Deep Learning techniques (i.e. Convolutional Neural Network). I am using Google's Tensor Flow and also Caffe for training, fine-tuning and extracting features.
## Dataset
Currently I am using Stanford Mobile Images dataset for measuring the performance.
